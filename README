This will be hopefully get to a fully working js implementation based pattern from java's "Remote Method Invocation". 

There is no network protocol defined between client and server, so don't try to connect to a java backend 
this is not intended.

I hope i will be able to handle complex api through the rmi.js like a database api:

conn = new Connection()
conn.open(conn).on('open', function(db) {
  db.getRow(id, function(row) {
    row.save()
  }
})

This version is developed on node.js but there is no dependency to anything unless JSON.stringify/parse
So it will be run also on every common javascript engine.
